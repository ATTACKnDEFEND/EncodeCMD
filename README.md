# EncodeCMD
This program encodes a given input file using a randomly generated key and writes the result to an output file. The encoding algorithm replaces each letter in the input file with a unique string of 6 lowercase letters, followed by the original letter enclosed in percentage signs. Non-letter characters are left as is.
